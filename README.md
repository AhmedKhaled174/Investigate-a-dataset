# Investigate-a-dataset
Udacity data analysis nonodegree project
# Project details
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment. 

● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital. 

● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.

● Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.

I should start by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I am most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. 

Question such as: What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
# PROJECT SPECIFICATION
## Code Functionality
1- All code is functional and produces no errors when run. The code given is sufficient to reproduce the results described.

2- The project uses NumPy arrays and Pandas Series and DataFrames where appropriate rather than Python lists and dictionaries. Where possible, vectorized operations and built-in functions are used instead of loops.

3- The code makes use of functions to avoid repetitive code. The code contains good comments and variable names, making it easy to read.
## Quality of Analysis
The project clearly states one or more questions, then addresses those questions in the rest of the analysis.

## Data Wrangling Phase
The project documents any changes that were made to clean the data, such as merging multiple files, handling missing values, etc.

## Exploration Phase
1- The project investigates the stated question(s) from multiple angles. At least three variables are investigated using both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.

2- The project's visualizations are varied and show multiple comparisons and trends. Relevant statistics are computed throughout the analysis when an inference is made about the data.

3- At least two kinds of plots should be created as part of the explorations.

## Conclusions Phase
The results of the analysis are presented such that any limitations are clear. The analysis does not state or imply that one change causes another based solely on a correlation.

## Communication
1- Reasoning is provided for each analysis decision, plot, and statistical summary.
Use Comments within your code to document the flow of analysis.
The code file is organized into sections:
Introduction; Data Wrangling; Exploratory Data Analysis; Conclusions
Data wrangling: Includes steps for data analysis should be clearly specified
Exploratory Data Analysis: The section communicates how the analysis addresses the research question
Conclusions: The section articulates how the analysis findings justify the results and summary.

2- Visualizations made in the project depict the data in an appropriate manner that allows plots to be readily interpreted.
